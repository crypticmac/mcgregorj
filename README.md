# mcgregorj
A java library for working with the McGregor protocol

To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed, and download Maven from:

  http://maven.apache.org/

Then run "mvn clean package" to compile the software. You can also run "mvn site:site" to generate a website with
useful information like JavaDocs. The outputs are under the target/ directory.

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. IntelliJ has Maven integration once you tell it where to
find your unzipped Maven install directory.


You can compile using "mvn clean install" when using mcgregorj with the android wallet created by schildbach.
